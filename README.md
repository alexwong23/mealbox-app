2)Purpose of this app!

We realise that both the man and the lady of the twenty first century is a busy bee.At the same time , people are over take-outs and prefer to have their own home cooked meals.
It's just such a drag to go to the supermarket after working 9-5, standing in those long checkout lines and lugging pounds of groceries home. Now with MealBox, people can cook
their own Gordon Ramsey style meals(well not quite Ramsey) with carefully planned recipies delivered straight to their front door. Moreover prices of ingredients match those available in
major supermarkets.
